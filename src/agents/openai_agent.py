I believe artificial intelligence development should have targeted, risk-based regulatory oversight rather than blanket restrictions or complete laissez-faire approaches.

**Core Position:**
Government agencies should regulate AI development through a tiered framework that scales oversight with potential risk and societal impact.

**Supporting Rationale:**

**1. Technical Necessity**
- High-risk AI systems (autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, financial trading) require rigorous safety standards
- Critical infrastructure AI needs mandatory security protocols and failsafe mechanisms
- Algorithm transparency is essential for systems affecting fundamental rights (hiring, lending, criminal justice)

**2. Innovation Balance**
- Overly restrictive regulation could stifle beneficial innovation and economic competitiveness
- Startups and research institutions need reasonable compliance pathways
- Rapid technological advancement requires adaptive regulatory frameworks

**3. Implementation Framework**
- **Tier 1 (High Risk)**: Strict pre-deployment testing, ongoing monitoring, liability requirements
- **Tier 2 (Medium Risk)**: Industry standards compliance, periodic auditing, incident reporting
- **Tier 3 (Low Risk)**: Self-certification, basic disclosure requirements

**4. International Coordination**
- Global AI leadership requires competitive regulatory environment
- Cross-border data and AI services need harmonized standards
- Regulatory arbitrage risks undermine effective oversight

**Conclusion:**
A risk-proportionate regulatory approach maximizes AI benefits while minimizing genuine harms through targeted, technically-informed oversight that preserves innovation incentives."""

                return """**Position: Python is Superior for Modern Web Development**

While JavaScript has traditionally dominated web development, I argue that Python offers significant advantages for comprehensive web application development in 2025.

**Core Argument:**
Python provides better long-term maintainability, developer productivity, and full-stack capabilities for complex web applications.

**Technical Advantages:**

**1. Backend Excellence**
- Django and FastAPI offer robust, batteries-included frameworks
- Superior data processing and analysis capabilities with pandas, NumPy
- Excellent database ORM systems (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)
- Strong async support with asyncio and modern frameworks

**2. Development Productivity**
- Clean, readable syntax reduces development time and bugs
- Comprehensive standard library minimizes external dependencies
- Excellent tooling ecosystem (pytest, black, mypy, ruff)
- Strong typing support improves code reliability

**3. Full-Stack Capabilities**
- Modern Python can handle frontend with frameworks like Reflex, Streamlit
- HTMX integration provides dynamic UIs without JavaScript complexity
- WebAssembly support enables browser-side Python execution
- API-first development with automatic documentation (FastAPI)

**4. Ecosystem Maturity**
- Machine learning integration (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for AI-powered features
- Extensive data science libraries for analytics and reporting
- Mature deployment tools (Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms)
- Strong security libraries and best practices

**5. Performance Considerations**
- Modern Python with PyPy and Cython offers competitive performance
- Async frameworks match Node.js performance for I/O-bound applications
- Better memory management for large-scale applications

**JavaScript Acknowledgments:**
JavaScript excels in client-side interactivity and has a mature ecosystem, but Python's advantages in maintainability, developer experience, and full-stack capabilities make it the better choice for complex, long-term web projects."""
